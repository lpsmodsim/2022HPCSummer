A story is the customer's narrative of a scenario

A model has variables, parameters, and state diagrams. Implemented in either DEVS or SST


# How to get from story to model

1. identify the boundaries of the system being modeled
1. identify independent components
1. is the model a flat graph or is hierarchy critical?

Each philosopher is an independent instance
Each chopstick is an independent instance

Philosophers interact only with adjacent chopsticks
